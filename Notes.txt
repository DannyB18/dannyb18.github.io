Notes to Continue:

Contact buttons misaligned in smaller viewports
This is due to font-size and added top margin on first button

To fix this,
First, add the top margin to the button container instead of button
at smaller viewports.
Then, create mediaqueries for the contact buttons and change the top
property appropriately
